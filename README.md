# ProceduralGolfV2  
Dissertation project w/ Unreal 4.21     
(modified & recompiled from source & installedbuild created version to solve seamjumping bug) 

Procedurally generated mini golf game 

Current methods:  

Maze Gen -> Creates a solve-able maze 
Snake Gen -> Creates a list of coordinates in a long wiggly line  
Room Gen -> Creates a tank controlled snake node which runs around dropping rooms then scans itself to make walls (very customisable) 


Planned:  

Heightmap / Natural / Noise (etc) based method -> procedurally generate some natural terrain  
Cave Generation -> based on punching out 0s from an array filled with 1s to create a cave like structure  
Cellular automata based method -> create a cave like structure via cellular automata
